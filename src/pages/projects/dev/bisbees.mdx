  summary: "A re-designed vision for the website of the most ambitious fishing tournaments in the world.",
  thoughts: "I had so much fun building this project, it started as a little static page and became a fully dynamic landing page. Every color and style was made to give a high-end classy but modern feel of Bisbee's and Los Cabos. I mean, it's the richest tournaments in the world, they deserve better.",
