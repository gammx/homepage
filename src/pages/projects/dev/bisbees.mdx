  thoughts: "It is more complex than the Cipriani's landing page, so I'm gonna use an advanced stack. I chose TypeScript over JavaScript as the project may scale in the future, I'll use TailwindCSS to speed up the process, SASS will provide us more complex solutions. Next.js is the cherry on the cake.",
